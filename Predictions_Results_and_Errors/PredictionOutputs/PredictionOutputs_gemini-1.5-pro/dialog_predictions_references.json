        "Wow, that's a lot of soup! I'd love to go to DC this summer.  Did you see anything else interesting happening there? Besides the crab feast, I mean.  There's a free Harry Potter talk at the library, or a Rico Nasty concert.\nI saw that Flasher is playing a free concert at Fort Reno too.  Maybe we could plan a trip?",
        "It's possible.  The Bears made him the highest-paid defensive player. My favorite team is the Green Bay Packers.  Rodgers is amazing, even though he had a rough start against the Bears this year. What about you?  Do you have a favorite team?",
        "He'd probably do it if she was good enough. Remember, he coached the Browns to their last playoff win back in '95.  He's all about winning.\nThat's right! Against the Patriots, ironically.  Belichick's first playoff win, too.  Crazy how things come full circle.\nIt is.  So, you think a woman could kick a game-winning field goal in the Super Bowl?\nAbsolutely.  Pressure's pressure, regardless of gender.",
        "Probably bought a house. Or maybe a bunch more baseball cards!  Did you ever collect cards as a kid? I had tons of them, mostly baseball but some football too.  Remember those holographic cards?",
        "Cumberland College, right?  1916.  Georgia Tech.  That's the one.  Brutal.  I can't imagine being on the losing side of that.  Makes the Browns look good.\nYeah, that's a whole different level of losing.  Almost makes me feel better about the Dolphins!",
        "I think it's encased in steel and other protective layers.  It's a pretty vital piece of infrastructure.  Speaking of old tech, did you know the trunk of your car is called that because old cars had literal trunks on the back?\nThat's interesting! I never knew that.  Kind of like how a \"dashboard\" was originally a board that stopped mud from splashing on the driver.",
        "i love daft punk's dedication to their image.  Did you see the movie Interstella 5555?  It's an anime film set entirely to the music of Discovery.  It's amazing!\nI have not seen that one either!  I will look for it, thanks for the tip.",
        "That's wild!  I wonder if 40% of Jupiter's electromagnetic storms are Canadian?  Maybe that's why they sound so good.  Do you think they play President Banana on Jupiter?  He'd be huge there!",
        "Oh, cool! I'm pretty good with the technical side. Did you know that little three-line menu icon everyone uses is called a hamburger button?  It's so ubiquitous now.\nReally? I had no idea! I always just called it a menu.  Learn something new every day. What else do you know?",
        "The barrier to entry is so low now.  I bet there's a secret room at Pixar filled with animators making YouTube videos on the side.\nMaybe. Or maybe they're all busy making shorts for Pixar's own YouTube channel.  They'd probably get flagged for copyright infringement pretty quickly.  Speaking of Pixar, have you seen their latest movie?",
        "I love basketball!  It's so exciting.  I haven't watched much hockey lately, but I used to go to a lot of games.  Do you have a favorite team?  I'm a big fan of the [insert team name].",
        "Imagine the medical advances we could make! 84% of human disease genes are in zebrafish.  We could learn so much from that immortal jellyfish too.\nMaybe it holds the secret to curing those diseases.\nThat would be amazing! Think of all the lives we could save. We should definitely study both of them.",
        "No, the first president of Zimbabwe was Canaan Banana.  And I don't think \"President Banana\" is a real title.  Also, back in the early US, the runner-up in the presidential election became the vice-president! Imagine having to work with your rival.",
        "I'm not sure about managers, but player cards can be very valuable.  Remember Honus Wagner?  His card is super rare.  Speaking of rare, do you think Doug Harvey's umpire card is worth anything now?  Probably not as much as a player's, but maybe it'll go up in value.",
        "No, I haven't.  Who is it?  Are they any good?  Six foot ten is incredibly tall for a tennis player, it must give them a huge advantage on serve.  Do they have a powerful serve?",
        "Oh, really?  I love Bill Murray! If he thinks it's that good, I'll have to check it out.  What's it about? Some kind of martial arts comedy?  Is it like a spoof?  Where can I watch it?",
        "Yeah, they're solid.  You know, Counsell could technically suit up and play for us if he had to.  Crazy, right?  Managers are actually part of the roster.  Think he could still hit a curveball?  Probably better than me!",
        "that's crazy!  I didn't know that.  Did you hear about the guy who sued Metallica because their music was too loud?  He claimed it damaged his hearing.\nReally? I wonder if he won.  Some concerts are painfully loud.  I always wear earplugs now.\nGood idea!  I should probably do that too.",
        "That's impressive!  Speaking of quarterbacks, did you know Brad Johnson is the only quarterback to ever throw a touchdown pass to himself?\nReally?  I didn't know that.  What a unique piece of football trivia!  I wonder how that even happened.",
        "I saw he's playing at the 9:30 Club on Thursday.  Have you seen him live?\nOh, cool! No, I haven't.  Tickets are a bit pricey though.\nYeah, $25.  Might be worth it though. He's supposed to be even funnier in person.\nHmm, tempting... maybe!  He did a great set on that Netflix special.",
        "Wow, that's surprising about *Sleeping Beauty*.  Speaking of flops, did you hear about *Trojan Wars*?  Fifteen million dollar budget and it made... $309.  That's gotta be one of the biggest bombs ever.  How does that even happen?",
        "No, he's a retired Hall of Famer.  One of the best shooters ever! Played for the Pacers.  He had a crazy story about scoring 40 points in high school, thinking he was hot stuff, only to find out his sister Cheryl scored 105 in the same day!  Can you believe that?",
        "No way!  Party balloons are doomed?  More importantly, what about MRI machines?  \nBack to the forests, though.  If you think about it in terms of Earth's whole history, we've wiped out a huge percentage in a tiny fraction of time. Like, less than a second on that 24-hour clock.  Pretty scary.",
        "Yeah, he seems like a stand-up guy.  Did you know Judge Judy makes more per episode than LeBron?  Crazy, right?  She's second only to him in celebrity earnings.  I wonder what kind of shoes she wears.  Probably not Nikes.",
        "She came out of retirement.  Brady makes a lot though, even with endorsements. I wonder what Belichick makes? He's got the most playoff wins ever, 31 now, not 21.  He won a couple more with the Patriots after Brady left.",
        "That's a good point!  Imagine the power.  I wonder if they lease it out for grazing or mining?  That must generate some serious revenue.  Maybe that's how they fund those floppy disks.  Speaking of which, do you think they have dial-up internet there?",
        "Not really, it's a bit too violent for me.  Plus, have you seen that Iowa locker room?\nIt's completely pink!  \nI heard about that!  It's supposed to be some kind of psychological tactic, right?  \nYeah, messing with the opposing team's masculinity or something.  Seems a bit silly to me.",
        "That's awesome!  I'm a [Team Name] fan myself.  Did you know managers wear uniforms just in case they need to sub in?  Crazy, right?  Though I can't imagine seeing Torey Lovullo take the field these days!",
        "Wow, that's interesting!  I didn't know that.  Speaking of crazy football facts, did you know the highest scoring game ever was 222-0? Georgia Tech crushed Cumberland back in 1916.  Crazy, right?",
        "I play a little guitar.  Did you know U2, the Irish rock band, once pretended to be a country band called The Dalton Brothers?  They even wore wigs and costumes!\nNo way! Really? That's hilarious.  I wonder if they played any Fender Stratocasters...",
        "It was a tumultuous period, lots of social and political upheaval.  Kind of like when Billy Mays died and all the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khakis.  Remember that?\nI vaguely remember something about that.  Why blue shirts and khakis, though?  Was that his favorite outfit or something?\nNo idea.  Just a weird detail that stuck with me.",
        "Wow, no rib cages?  That's crazy!  So what holds them together?  I'd love to go scuba diving with them sometime, but that also terrifies me.  Have you ever seen one in person?",
        "It's interesting how few women play professional football.  I wonder if we'll ever see a female quarterback in the NFL?\nThat would be amazing!  I don't see why not, if they're good enough.  It's not like there's a rule against it.\nTrue!  Maybe someday soon.  It would definitely change the game.",
        "Hiccups are a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had both gills and lungs.  The hiccup reflex is thought to be a remnant of this transition.  Pretty cool, huh?\nThat is cool! I wonder what other evolutionary quirks we still have.",
        "That's crazy!  I didn't know that.  So, back to the spelling bee draft, are you going with Navneeth this year? He seems like a strong pick.  Or maybe you're banking on a dark horse?  I'm thinking about picking up Simone, she's got a good track record.",
        "That sounds like fun!  I'd love to hear about it when you get back.  Speaking of music, have you ever listened to the sounds of the sun? There's a radio station that translates solar activity into music. It's pretty wild!",
        "Wow!  That's a lot for a bow.  I wonder what kind of music you'd play with a gold bow?  Would it sound different than a regular violin bow, or is it just for show?  Maybe it's for fiddling!  Speaking of fiddling...",
        "That's alarming!  What will parades and birthday parties be like without balloons?  Speaking of parties, are you going to the Noogler event on Friday? Don't forget your propeller beanie!  I hear there's going to be cake.",
        "That's cool!  I loved Edna Mode in the first one.  Speaking of the first one, did you ever play that old Incredibles video game, Rise of the Underminer?  It was a sort of sequel.  I remember playing it years ago.\nNo, I never played it.  I'll have to look it up.  Was it any good?",
        "Really? I had no idea!  I always thought it was an ancient technique.  So, before that, the British only used the breaststroke?  That's fascinating!  I wonder how much faster the front crawl is.  Maybe that's why they lost!",
        "I agree.  He's had a lot of obstacles.  It's too bad there aren't more choices besides Republican or Democrat.  It's been that way for so long!  Have you ever looked into any of the other parties?",
        "Wow, a cat mayor? That's amazing!  Talkeetna, right? I've heard of that.  Maybe Stubbs has some good policies on napping.  My cat would vote for him.  So, which cafe sounds most appealing to you?  I'm leaning towards the meerkats.",
        "Wow, I didn't know that about Naismith!  Speaking of college ball, it's crazy how much those coaches get paid.  In most states, the highest-paid state employee is a college football or basketball coach!  What do you think about that?\nThat's insane!  They make more than governors and professors?  It really puts the emphasis on sports, doesn't it?",
        "i agree.  It sets a bad precedent if they let him off easy.  Do you think they'll ever recover all the money?\nProbably not.  It's likely long gone.  Spent on who knows what.  A shame for those who lost out.",
        "Wow, that's interesting!  Did you know BenJarvus Green-Ellis, a former Patriots running back, never fumbled in his entire NFL career?  That's incredible ball security.  I wonder if they tracked *that* stat.  He was a beast!",
        "I do, I love to dance!  Have you heard of that website with all the old radio dramas?  Perfect background music for a dance party.  You'd probably like it, given your appreciation for classic influences like Shakespeare.",
        "I actually went the other day to check out the Library of Things.  Did you know you can borrow a sewing machine?  It's pretty cool!\nReally? I had no idea! I'll have to check that out. Maybe I'll finally get around to hemming those pants.  What else do they have?\nTools, kitchen appliances... all sorts of stuff. You should browse their website.",
        "Yeah, I get that.  It felt a little hypocritical. Did you see that video of her walking backward to avoid paparazzi?  Kind of ironic for someone who wants to control their image so much.  Speaking of celebrities, have you heard...?",
        "Not really.  Mostly streaming.  You?\nSame.  I haven't had cable in years.  It's so much easier to just watch what I want, when I want.  Plus, it's cheaper!\nSo true.  Do you have any recommendations? I'm always looking for something new to watch.",
        "That's incredible! I can barely read 300 words a minute.  Speaking of incredible, did you know Howard Berg supposedly reads 25,000 words a minute?  Though, that's disputed.  Makes Anne Jones seem slow!  Ever try listening to audiobooks at higher speeds?",
        "They're not really working *together*.  They took similar actions against the same company, Predictim.  Both banned them for violating their rules on data privacy and surveillance.  They're competitors, but they both have similar rules about how developers can use their data.",
        "Brad Bird.  He also directed the first one. And get this \u2013 he's the voice of Edna Mode!  They couldn't find an actress who could capture her\u2026 *ahem* distinctive personality.  Pretty amazing, right?",
        "I love it too!  Though I heard this crazy thing about the Saints cheerleaders. They aren't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players!  Can you believe that?  They even have to leave if a player comes in while they're there.  Seems a bit much, don't you think?",
        "i like their documentaries too. have you seen any of the nature ones? they're really well made.  What kind of movies do you like?  I'm always looking for recommendations.  I mostly watch comedies or thrillers.",
        "Yeah, I do.  Heard about that Burger King thing where you unfriend ten people for a free Whopper?  Crazy, right?  I'd never do it, but I guess some people really love Whoppers.  Think it's true?\nI saw a few people talking about it.  Not sure if it's real or not.  Ten friends is a lot to sacrifice for a burger, though.  Even a Whopper.",
        "It is weird.  Hey, did you hear about the UN ambassador for aliens back in 2010?  Pretty crazy, right?\nImagine if they actually made contact. What would we even say?  \"Sorry about the forests and the helium?\"\nProbably best to lead with \"We come in peace!\"  Ha!",
        "Creed?  Wow, that bad, huh? I remember them being popular for a while.  I saw Metallica once, back in... I don't know, the 90s?  Giant stadium show, pyrotechnics, the whole deal.  Nothing like a Christmas concert, that's for sure.",
        "I buy tons of stuff from Amazon.  I think the clock is supposed to be some kind of 10,000-year monument to long-term thinking.  Kind of ironic given Amazon's focus on next-quarter profits, don't you think?  It's inside a mountain he owns in Texas."

        "so , i 'm reading the latest film from studio ghibli is out the tale of princess kaguya . dunno if you 're familiar with them , but studio ghibli has made a lot of great animated films , like spirited away , and princess mononoke \n i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award \n yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their \" home grown \" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out . \n i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to \n sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ? \n\n",
        "i think that jon gruden is a sensible loss for the team , \n what do you mean by sensible loss ? i think john gruden is a huge mistake for the team . \n well i think his a good player , hard to replace , that s what i meant or at least in the raiders team his become an important piece for the coach \n john gruden is an nfl head coach . he 's not a player . the 33 - 13 loss to the rams was just the beginning of a miserable season . are you familiar with the nfl ? \n oh i see , i guess i m confusing him with a player of the team , what was his name i think it was khalil mack , and i do follow some games what about you ? \n football is one of my favorite sports and i follow all 32 teams . khalil mack was traded to the bears by john gruden for some picks . they definitely felt his absence . i do n't know why they did n't just resign him . \n maybe he demanded a high salary ? what is your favorite nfl team ? \n\n",
        "hello \n hi . the nfl seems to be at the end of its days . \n that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet . \n what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players . \n i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along . \n what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down . \n that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go . \n i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans . \n oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick . \n i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true . \n i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver . \n women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ? \n this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage . \n belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products . \n\n",
        "hi there , how 's it going ? \n it 's going great ! which do you prefer , football or baseball ? \n oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore . \n baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact . \n yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ? \n i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games . \n yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ? \n 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something . \n yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ? \n the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 . \n yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics \n i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball . \n yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us \" run to fourth ! \" and we were like , \" you mean home ? run home ? \" \n baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect \" rounders \" cards the way we collect baseball cards . \n right ? i wonder if they have cricket cards lol ? i think they have stickers for soccer . \n some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money . \n yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s . \n thanks , grandpa ! i bet grandpa wishes he had cashed them in before he cashed out . \n\n",
        "hi ! do you follow football ? \n sorry , i ca n't say that i do , i'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it . \n that is about how much i know , just the basics , and some fun trivia . \n i used to live in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new to me , is he the quarterback ? \n yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then . \n now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , but he transcends that stereotype . \n he really does , he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too . \n do you go to football games ? i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university . \n i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway \n i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play . \n it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis . \n i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works . \n i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder . \n do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support . \n i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud . \n it could be worse , i read about this team that lost 220 - 0 . it would be hard to watch to the end . \n\n",
        "did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha \n i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using . \n haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha \n yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten . \n right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious \n that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ? \n i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute \n i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way \n ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military \n i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe \n ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion \n i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 . \n ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! ! \n it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them . \n ya it 's only about 3 inches thick , i wonder how it is protected ? is it just a cable or are there safeguards in place in case like a ship sinks and crushes it , etc \n\n",

        "do you still use a landline ? \n no . in my opinion , the landline is going extinct . growing up my grandparents had a multi - party line . my parents had a landline . i killed the landline once cellular was cost effective . now cellphones are small computers that do so much more than landlines . \n yeah , an iphone has more computing power than a mainframe of the 60s . but data still travels best in cables . \n even on cellular networks , it still travels via cable , except for the last leg . could you imagine the atmospheric distortion of the signal if data was transmitted from the east to west coast solely via the airways ? \n we would be still at the era of ham radios and telegram . there would be less pictures . \n less pictures and more garbled messages . imagine how youtube videos would look with atmospheric distortion ; probably like the picture on old time tvs with rabbit ear antennas ? \n youtube would be like a tv station , showing only clip to everyone at the same time . i think it would be less popular . \n true . do you subscribe to any youtube channels or follow any youtube celebrities ? \n i subscribe to some educational channels . but i do n't follow any celebrities , but i hear of them often . \n i use to subscribe to certain hunting / fishing equipment youtube channels , but found temptation to buy the latest thing to be unproductive . i do like \" how to \" videos on youtube . given that youtube is accessible to anyone with a computer , being a star has nothing to do with how good your hollywood agent is and more with establishing a populist following . \n it is more diverse but celebrities still have an advantage on youtube , being a search engine , popular results get more visibility . \n agreed . it is a bit art / a bit science in figuring out how to get your videos promoted in the search results . or , hire an expert who will flood your videos with fictional views to promote its popularity . but established names also help . judge judy makes $ 123k per tv episode ; with that amount of draw , her youtube channel ca n't help but be a success . \n do you think 123 000 $ per episode is too much for her ? \n i do not watch her , so i can not judge . it is one of the few areas where free market economics still reigns . so , if they feel she 's worth it , then it 's not my place to judge . but that type of draw opens up other markets . for example , carol burnett was the first celeb on sesame street . \n it was the 70s , she was the star at that time , it makes sense . i wonder if youtube will have a lasting impact on the star system or this youtubers thing is just a phase . \n it is definitely here to stay if not expanding . in the early days , you needed a good freestanding camera to make a good video . today , most cell phones have a good enough camera to make a youtube videos . some high end phones can shoot videos almost indistinguishable from freestanding cameras . \n\n",
