        "Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.",
        "\"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities,\" she said.",
        "Despite the improvement of telemedicine services to counter distances, she proposed as a possible remedy an enhancement of the service of flown-in doctors to enable specialists to provide care for women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.",

        "The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five to six percent.",
        "At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices rose only 1.4 percent over the year.",
        "Mr. Lawless further said that with the beginning of spring, an increase in properties for sale would be observed in the coming months, which would subject the market to \"a real test\".",
