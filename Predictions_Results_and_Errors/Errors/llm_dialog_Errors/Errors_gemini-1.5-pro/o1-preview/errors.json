        "output": "Yes, it's a fascinating piece of football trivia! In 1997, during a game between the Minnesota Vikings and the Carolina Panthers, Brad Johnson became one of the few quarterbacks in NFL history to throw a touchdown pass to himself. Here's how it happened:\n\nJohnson attempted a pass, but a defensive lineman tipped the ball at the line of scrimmage. The deflected ball bounced back into Johnson's hands. Reacting quickly, he caught it and ran into the end zone for a touchdown. Since he both threw the pass and caught it, he was credited with a touchdown pass to himself.\n\nIt's a rare and memorable play. Interestingly, other quarterbacks have also achieved this unusual feat, such as Marcus Mariota in a 2018 playoff game. Moments like these are part of what makes football so exciting!"
