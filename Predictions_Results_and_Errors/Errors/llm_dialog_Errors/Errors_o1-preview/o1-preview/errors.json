        "output": "Yes, Khalil Mack was indeed seeking a high salary. The Chicago Bears offered him a six-year, $141 million contract, making him one of the highest-paid defensive players at the time. The Raiders chose not to match that offer, partly due to their financial commitments to other contracts like those of quarterback Derek Carr and head coach Jon Gruden. \n\nAs for my favorite NFL team, I'm a fan of the Kansas City Chiefs. What about you?"
