        "\"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are usually found in larger cities,\" she said.",
        "Despite the improvement of telemedical services to counter distances, she proposed an increase in the service of visiting doctors as a possible remedy, in order to give specialists the possibility of caring for women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.",
