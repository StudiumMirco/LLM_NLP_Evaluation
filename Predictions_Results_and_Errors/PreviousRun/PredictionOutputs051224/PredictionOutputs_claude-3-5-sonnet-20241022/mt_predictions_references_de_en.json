        "Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admitting privileges, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.",
        "If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation out of fear for his safety, the group said.",

        "For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.",
        "Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.",
        "\"This disease is best treated by gynecologic oncologists, and they are usually found in larger cities,\" she said.",
        "Despite the improvement of telemedicine services to counter the distances, she proposed as a possible remedy an enhancement of the service of fly-in doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide care for women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.",
